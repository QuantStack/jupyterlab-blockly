Welcome to jupyterlab-blockly's documentation!
=================================================

This JupyterLab extension brings block-based programming directly to your web browser. You can easily use the JupyterLab-Blockly editor and choose from a wide selections of blocks to start coding, see the output of your code and, most importantly, visualize the code transformed in the chosen classical programming language. 

The extension uses `Blockly <https://developers.google.com/blockly>`_, an open source library designed by Google.
